            <p>The series opens with the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, which claims the life of <i>James Crawley</i>, the heir to Downton Abbey. This tragedy sets in motion a succession crisis that threatens the estate's future. The Earl of Grantham, Robert Crawley, must navigate the complex entail laws that prevent his daughters from inheriting, while his American wife Cora's fortune is tied to the estate. Meanwhile, the servants below stairs deal with their own dramas, including the scheming footman Thomas Barrow and the ambitious valet John Bates, whose mysterious past creates tension. The season explores the rigid class system of <strong>Edwardian England</strong>, showing how both upstairs and downstairs lives are interconnected yet distinctly separate.</p>
