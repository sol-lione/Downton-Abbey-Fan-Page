                    <p>Mary is the eldest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Grantham, she is stubborn, strong-minded, and a bit spoiled and self-centered.
                        She is Matthew's widow and the mother of Master George the heir to Robert's earldom, after her husband dies she inherits his half of the state.
                        Thus she becomes the agent of Downton, later she gets married again to race driver Henry Talbot.

                    <h3>Mr Matthew Crawley</h3>
                    <p>Matthew was a lawyer, he moves to Yorkshire after the former heir of the earldom and Downton Abbey dies on the Titanic.
                        He has a hard time bonding with the family, given that he grew up middle class and has a job.
                        After almost getting paralized during The Great War, his fiancee dies of the Spanish Flu; on her deathbed she urges him to marry Lady Mary.
                        Conflicted, he waits months to propose to Mary, settling the, almost a decade long, "will they, won't they??".
                        A year after they marry Matthew dies on a car crash, only hours after Mary gives birth to George Crawley, their son.</p>

                    <h3>Lady Sybil Crawley</h3>
                    <p>Sybil is just as strong minded as her older sister, but she has more of modern an political focus. Enable by the new, young and irish chauffeur, Tom, she becomes a women's right avtivist.
                        Much to her family's dismay, she is also the first of the sisters to acquire a job, as a nurse during the First World War. 
                        Bonded over their political views and values, she falls in love with Tom.
                        In one the most gutrenching scene of the show, Sybil Branson dies of eclampsia at 24 years old, after giving birth to her daughter, Sybbie.</p>

                    <h3>Mr Tom Branson</h3>
                    <p>[cue "Tears" from Sabrina Carpenter] Tom Branson is a lower class mechanic and an irish socialist. He arrives at Downton as the chauffeur, proud of his country and engulf on radical socialist views.
                        He founds his match on Sybil, so they expose their desire to marry to the family, who don't approve but also do not shun her from their home.
                        After becoming a widower, Tom makes a home of the Abbey, he comes to think of the Crawleys as his own. He also becomes the agent of the state before stablishing a car business with Mr Talbot.
